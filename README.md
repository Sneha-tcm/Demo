# Auto-formfilling-AI-agent
Users frequently fill out long, repetitive web forms with information that already exists in a Google Sheet (e.g., company name, address, website).  This project aims to build a browser extension that automatically matches and fills form fields using AI — so users can complete forms faster and with fewer errors.
